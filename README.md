# ðŸŒŸ Twitter(X) Sentiment Analysis Web App ðŸŒŸ

This is a simple web app that uses a **Logistic Regression** model to analyze the sentiment of a tweet. Built using **Streamlit**, it classifies tweets as **Positive** or **Negative** and displays a confidence score for the prediction.

## Features

- **Tweet Sentiment Classification**: Predicts whether a tweet is positive or negative using a Logistic Regression model.
- **Confidence Score**: Displays the confidence level of the sentiment classification.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit, providing an intuitive and attractive user experience.
- **Clean and Simple Design**: Emphasizes usability with a modern, friendly UI.

## Demo

You can try out the app [https://sentiment-analysis-x.streamlit.app/]([https://share.streamlit.io/your-app](https://sentiment-analysis-x.streamlit.app/)).

## How It Works

The app is powered by a **Logistic Regression** model trained on a labeled dataset of tweets. The workflow includes the following steps:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: The tweet is cleaned by removing non-alphabetical characters and stopwords.
2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: The cleaned text is converted into numerical format using **TF-IDF** vectorization.
3. **Sentiment Prediction**: The Logistic Regression model predicts whether the tweet has a positive or negative sentiment.
4. **Confidence Score**: The probability of the sentiment classification is displayed as a confidence score.
